# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an interactive game built using mostly the Javascript module pattern.
It allows two players to play against each other and reports the usual game stuff(wins, ties, scores, etc.).
Players are able to change their name and **let the AI play for them** at any time during a match.
_Similarly a player could play against the AI for the complete duration of a match, as well as subsequent matches._


The AI is an implementation of the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), with varying levels of difficulty.


Have fun!
